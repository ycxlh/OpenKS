<AbstractNarration>Most research on the complex biological interactions that inhabit coral reefs has focused on larger organisms that are easily observed by divers. However, marine scientists are increasingly aware of the importance of the tiny organisms that make up the "smaller majority."  This includes parasites, organisms that feed on other organisms without killing them, which may make up as many as 80% of the species on coral reefs. Among the most important parasitic organisms on coral reefs are gnathiid isopods, so-called 'ticks of the sea', that share many similarities with blood-feeding ticks and other arthropods on land. Like ticks and mosquitoes, gnathiids transmit malaria-like blood parasites. In high numbers, they can remove enough blood to kill adult fish, but even a single gnathiid can kill a juvenile fish. Thus, gnathiids may have a significant effect on coral reef communities through their effects on coral reef fishes. This project will use an integrative interdisciplinary approach involving field and laboratory observations and experiments, and molecular tools. In addition to contributing to our understanding of life in our oceans, this research will provide continued support for U.S. Doctoral and Masters students and will create valuable research opportunities for undergraduates from multiple institutions. The project will further build on the investigators existing relationships with resource managers, local divers, fishers, and boat operators, as well as K-12 schools and environmental education programs, and will contribute to local economies. A major goal of our outreach efforts will include an exhibit featuring our research at Coral World Ocean Park on St. Thomas, participation in Virgin Islands radio programs, and hosting high school students from South Carolina Governor's School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal this investigation is to understand the ecology of fish-parasite interactions on coral reef and associated ecosystems. This project focuses on fish-parasitic gnathiid isopods, the most common ectoparasites of coral reef fishes that are best known for their role in cleaning symbiosis, as the major food item of cleaner fishes. However, their abundance, host range, role as micropredator, disease vector, and potential prey item for other species, as well as their strong association with the benthos suggests the potential for much stronger community impacts.  The goals for this project are to: 1) characterize the factors influencing local gnathiid isopod density by examining the role of fish-hosts, benthic cover, gnathiid predators including cleaners, and gnathiid conspecific attraction; 2) determine and quantify variation in host exploitation and the effects of gnathiid density on larval fish-host recruitment. To accomplish the first objective, the investigators will trap gnathiids from the substrate at sites in the Caribbean, Australia, and the Philippines. Variables associated with benthic habitat as well as local fish communities will be quantified and compared with local gnathiid abundance. Laboratory experiments will be conducted to determine the effects of different host species on gnathiid growth and reproduction and to determine the role of conspecific attraction in the formation of aggregations. Predators of gnathiids will be identified through examination of gut contents and through laboratory feeding studies. To accomplish the second objective, patterns of host-exploitation will be determined by DNA barcoding of blood meals from wild-caught gnathiids and results compared with the availability of different host species. To determine the effects of gnathiids on early life history stages of coral reef fishes, gnathiid abundance will be manipulated on small artificial patch reefs onto which newly-settled reef fishes will be transplanted.</AbstractNarration>
